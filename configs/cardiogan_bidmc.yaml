# CardioGAN Training Configuration for BIDMC Dataset
#
# Paper: "CardioGAN: Attentive Generative Adversarial Network with Dual Discriminators
#         for Synthesis of ECG from PPG" (AAAI 2021)
# Dataset: BIDMC (53 subjects, 125 Hz native, resampled to 128 Hz)
#
# Usage:
#   python models/train_cardiogan.py --config configs/cardiogan_bidmc.yaml
#
# Note: CardioGAN uses different parameters than PPG2ECG:
#   - 128 Hz sampling rate (vs 125 Hz for PPG2ECG)
#   - 512 samples per window (vs 256)
#   - 4 seconds per window (vs 2 seconds)

# Model configuration
model:
  type: cardiogan
  input_size: 512                  # Window size (512 samples @ 128 Hz = 4s)
  base_filters: 64                 # Base filter count for conv layers

# Data configuration
# Note: Reuses PPG2ECG preprocessed data, resamples internally to 512 samples
data:
  train_path: external_data/bidmc_processed/train.pt
  test_path: external_data/bidmc_processed/test.pt
  sampling_rate: 128               # Hz (internal resampling from 125 Hz)

# Training configuration (from paper)
training:
  epochs: 50                       # Paper uses 15 on full dataset, we use more for smaller BIDMC
  batch_size: 16                   # Smaller than paper (8-32) for single GPU
  learning_rate: 0.0002            # Standard GAN learning rate
  beta1: 0.5                       # Adam momentum (standard for GANs)
  beta2: 0.999                     # Adam second moment
  patience: 20                     # Early stopping patience
  seed: 2019
  data_augmentation: false         # Disable for GAN training stability

# Loss configuration (from paper)
# L_total = α * L_adv + β * L_cycle + λ * L_recon
loss:
  alpha: 3.0                       # Adversarial loss weight
  beta: 1.0                        # Cycle consistency weight (not used in simplified version)
  lambda_recon: 30.0               # Reconstruction loss weight

# Output configuration
output:
  checkpoint_dir: checkpoints/cardiogan_bidmc/
  log_dir: logs/cardiogan_bidmc/
  save_every: 10                   # Save checkpoint every N epochs
  eval_every: 1                    # Evaluate every N epochs

# Device configuration
device:
  use_amp: false                   # AMP not recommended for GAN training
  num_workers: 4                   # DataLoader workers
